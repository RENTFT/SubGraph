# ReNFT Subgraph

We have four contracts in our subgraph.yaml. These represent collateral (Azrael) and collateral-free (Sylvester) contracts on both the mainnet and rinkeby. The reason for having all four in one subgraph is for easy maintainability (versus having four different subgraphs), and for easier management of decentralised subgraph (only need to top curate / index one subgraph).
